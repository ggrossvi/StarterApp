App Brainstorming

Some ideas to improve the app are: 

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Change other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

Favorite applications and features

   c. The song that is playing stays in place but you can scroll/move the rest of the page  
2. Netflix

This is what my app looks like currently.
