App Brainstorming

This app changes the background when you press the change color button.  

Some ideas to improve the app are: 

- Ask person their mood and change the background based on their mood.
- Make a function that takes in their mood and based on their response changes their mood.  
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Change other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

The next app I would like to work on is YappiHappi - An app for people who walk their dog/s and want to chat with others while they walk their dog/s.  They can chat with others in person or virtually.
